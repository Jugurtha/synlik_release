<p>Synthetic Likelihood (SL) is a statistics methodology, introduced by Wood (2010), which can be used to do inference for models were the likelihood function is unavailable or intractable. SL is a general-purpose methodology in the sense that, as long as the user is able to simulate data from his model, he should be able to fit it. For this reason, the <strong>synlik</strong> R package puts very few limitations on the model being fitted: the user has simply to provide a simulator and (optionally) a function that transforms that data into summary statistics. </p>

<p>The packages has been written with attention to computational efficiency and most of the functions provided by the package supports computation on multiple cores. At the moment <strong>synlik</strong> includes a set of simple, but useful and well documented statistical tools. In the future the package will be often updated and improved by the addition of new statistical methods and tools.</p>

<p>To check what <strong>synlik</strong> does, download of install it from here or from CRAN and have a look at its vignette:</p>
